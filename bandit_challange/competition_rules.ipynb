    "## Multi Armed Bandit Coding Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules:\n",
    "1. Write an algorithm that interacts wiith mutli armed bandit to gather as many points as possible.\n",
    "2. Your algorithm can only access `n_arms` and `n_trials` properties and use `pull` method to gather points.\n",
    "3. Other than that, there are no further rules – you can build any algorithm you want – e.g. based on probability, reinforcement learning, heuristics, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup:\n",
    "1. On each new game, there will be fixed number of arms (randomly selected between 2 and 10) and trials (randomly selected between 10 and 500)\n",
    "2. Each arm will be associated with fixed (for the duration of single game) reward distribution.\n",
    "3. Reward distribution is always **normal (Gaussian)** with mean between randomly selected from interval [0, 100] and standard deviation randomly selected from interval [0, 100].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competition\n",
    "1. During competition, each algorithm will play 1 million games (random seed will be fixed for all competitors).\n",
    "2. Algorithm that get the most points will win the competition."
